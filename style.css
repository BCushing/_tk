 == Quick CSS styling tips ==

 You can start off in a rough direction with some minimal styles.
 See below for some tips. ;)

  
 == Want to have the whole site wrapped? ==  
  
 Just fill the .container class with some background color to have a the whole site "wrapped".
 This works so easy because every main part is wrapped only once into a container class by bootstrap. 
 Try out by decommenting the next line and go from there. 
	
 .container { background: #f9f9f9; border-right: 1px solid #eee; border-left: 1px solid #eee; }


 == Want to wrap just the content and sidebar in Bootstrap style? == 
  
 That one is a great example to show that some things are much cleaner and easier to do via just adding some HTML classes. 
 In this case, we will add just one CSS class "panel", look for example at the beginning in content.php!
